## <a id="proxy-api"></a> Monitor Node Health Using the API

You can also use the Switchboard API to obtain the information that is shown on the Switchboard dashboard.

For example, you might want to use the API to write your own app to monitor the cluster.

To monitor node health using the Switchboard API, do the following:

1. To monitor node health, run the following command:

    ```
    curl https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@N-HOSTNAME/v0/backends
    ```

    Where:
    + `USERNAME` is the `username` you recorded in [Prerequisite](#prereq) above.
    + `PASSWORD` is the `password` you recorded in [Prerequisite](#prereq) above.
    + `N` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the proxy you want to connect to. 
    + `HOSTNAME` is the `hostname` you recorded in [Prerequisite](#prereq) above.
    
    The above command outputs a JSON object similar to the following: 

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ curl https://abcdefghijklmno:012345678912345@0-proxy.123abc45-67d8-912e-34f5-g34612c10dba.org.dedicated-mysql.cf-app.com/v0/backends
