* <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> periodically sends an error log similar to the following:
      <pre class="terminal">http: TLS handshake error from 127.0.0.1:RANDOM-PORT: EOF</pre>
       <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> sends this log even though the TLS
       handshake is not failing. This issue is not an issue with security.
