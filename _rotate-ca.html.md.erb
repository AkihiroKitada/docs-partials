This topic describes how to rotate certificate authority (CA) certificates. If you are using TLS for MySQL for PCF, you provided a CA certificate to BOSH CredHub when performing the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html). Operators must rotate these CA certificates before they expire or if they are compromised. 

##<a id='rotate'></a> Rotate a CA Certificate

To rotate CA certificates, you must do the following:

+ Generate and add a CA certificate with CredHub. See [Generate and Add a CA Certificate](#add-generate).
+ Regenerate certificates signed by the old CA certificate. See, [Regenerate Certificates Instances](#regenerate).
+ Remove the old CA certificate. See [Remove Old the CA Certificate](#remove).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not attempt to rotate a CA certificate on your own.
Contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>
and perform the following procedures with their assistance.</p>

### <a id="add-generate"></a> Generate and Add a CA Certificate

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This procedure involves restarting
all of the VMs in your PCF deployment in order to apply a CA certificate. The
operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

To generate and add a CA certificate, following the procedures below:

####<a id='credhub-creds'></a> Find the CredHub Credentials in Ops Manager

You need the BOSH CredHub client name and client secret to complete the
[Add the CA Certificate](#add-ca-cert) procedure below.

To find the BOSH CredHub client name and client secret, do the following:

1. In the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the BOSH Director tile.
1. Click the **Credentials** tab.
1. In the BOSH Director section, click the link to the BOSH Commandline Credentials.
![CredHub Credentials](credhub-creds.png)
1. Record the values for `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.<br>
  For example:

    ```
    {"credential":"BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=abCdE1FgHIjkL2m3n-3PqrsT4EUVwXy5
    BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh "}
  ```
  The `BOSH_CLIENT` is the BOSH CredHub client name and the `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` is
  the BOSH CredHub client secret.

####<a id='add-ca-cert'></a> Add the CA Certificate

<!-- UPDATE PROCEDURE -->

To generate and add the CA Certificate to Ops Manager, do the following:

1. From the Ops Manager VM, to set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH
CredHub server, run the following: 

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
  Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
  <br><br>
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
  </pre>

1. To log in to CredHub, run the following:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:<br>
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` in
    [Find the CredHub Credentials](#credhub-creds) above.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` in
    [Find the CredHub Credentials](#credhub-creds) above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>
1. To check whether a services CA certificate already is present, run the following:

    ```
    credhub get --name="/services/tls_ca"
    ```
    If you already have a certificate at the `services/tls_ca` path, skip step 4.

1. To generate a CA certificate or provide an existing one, do one of the following:
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Your PCF deployment may have
  multiple CA certificates.
   Pivotal recommends using a dedicated CA certificate for services.</p>
    * If you do not have a CA certificate, to generate a CA certificate run the following:
    
        ```
        credhub generate \
        --name="/services/tls_ca" \
        --type="certificate" \
        --is-ca \
              --common-name="rootCA"
        ```  
    * If you have an existing CA certificate that you want to use, create
    a new file called `root.pem` with the contents of the certificate.
    Then run the following command:
    
        ```
        credhub set \
            --name="/services/tls_ca" \
            --type="certificate" \
            --certificate=PEM-PATH/root.pem \
            --private=CERT-KEY...
        ```
      Where:
      * `PEM-PATH` is the path to the `root.pem` file.
      * `CERT-KEY` is the private key for the certificate.
1. To extract and print the `certificate` portion from the CA certificate,
run the following command:

    ```
    bosh int <(credhub get \
    --name=/services/tls_ca) \
    --path /value/certificate
    ```
    <%# Double check right bosh command %>
1. Copy the output.
1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and select the BOSH Director tile.
Click **Security**.
1. Append the contents of the new CA certificate to the old CA certificate under **Trusted Certificates**. Do not remove the old CA certificate. Click **Save**.
9. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.
This restarts all the VMs in your PCF deployment and applies your CA certificate. 

### <a id="regenerate"></a> Regenerate Certificates

To regenerate your certificates and redeploy your service instances, follow the procedure below:

1. To log in to CredHub, run the following:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME \
    --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` in
    [Find the CredHub Credentials](#credhub-creds) above.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` in
    [Find the CredHub Credentials](#credhub-creds) above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre> 
    
1. To regenerate all certificates signed but the old CA certificate, run the following

    ```
    curl "https://BOSH-DIRECTOR/api/v1/bulk-regenerate"" -X POST \
    -d '{ "signed_by": "/services/tls_ca" }'\
    -H "authorization: bearer $(credhub --token)"\
    -H 'content-type: application/json'
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM. 
    
1. To redeploy all service instances with the new certificates, run the following: 

    ```
    bosh -d p-mysql-GUID run-errand upgrade-all-service instances  
    ```
    Where `pivotal-mysql-GUID` is the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker.

<%# All bound apps that do not validate server certificates using the trusted store must be re-bound to the service in order to receive the updated CA public key. This includes all apps that are not written in Java or Spring. Until these apps have been re-bound, they cannot reconnect to the service. %>

                                   
### <a id="remove"></a> Remove Old the CA Certificate

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This procedure involves restarting
	all of the VMs in your PCF deployment in order to apply a CA certificate. The
	operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

After all of your apps have reconnected to service instances with certificates generated by the new CA, do the following to remove the old CA certificate:

1. To remove the old CA certificate, run the following:
    
    ```
    credhub delete --name '/services/tls_ca
    ```
1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click the BOSH Director tile. Click **Security**.

1. Remove the old CA certificate in Trusted Certificates and click **Save**.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**. This restarts all the VMs in your deployment.
