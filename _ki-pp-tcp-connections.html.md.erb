* The pre-provisioned broker does not terminate failed TCP connections.
  Over time, this can cause the file descriptor limit on the VMs that host HAProxy and the pre-provisioned broker to reach capacity:
    * When capacity is reached on the HAProxy VM, RabbitMQ is unreachable.
    To resolve this, restart the `haproxy` monit job on the HAProxy VM.
    If the VM is unresponsive, restart it.<br><br>
    * When capacity is reached on the pre-provisioned broker, app developers cannot create, bind, unbind, or delete service instances.
    To resolve this, restart the `rabbitmq-service-broker` monit job on the pre-provisioned broker VM.
    If the VM is unresponsive, restart it.
