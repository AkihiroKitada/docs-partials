    description: 'Upgrade All Service Instances Errand Fails',

    symptom: 'The <a href="#upgrade-all"><code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code></a> errand fails.',

    cause: '',

    solution: 'To troubleshoot:
    <ol>
    <li>Look at the errand output in the Ops Manager log.</li>

    <li>If an instance has failed to upgrade, debug and fix it before running the errand again
    to prevent any failure issues from spreading to other on-demand instances.</li>

    <li>Once the Ops Manager log no longer lists the deployment as <code>failing</code>,
    <a href="#upgrade-all">re-run the errand</a> to upgrade the rest of the instances.</li>
    </ol>
'}%>
