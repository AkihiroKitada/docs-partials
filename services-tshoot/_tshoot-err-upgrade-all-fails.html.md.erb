<p>
  If the <a href="#upgrade-all"><code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code></a> errand fails,
  look at the errand output in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> log.
</p>

<p>
  If an instance fails to upgrade, debug and fix it before running the errand again
  to prevent any failure issues from spreading to other on-demand instances.
</p>

<p>
  Once the <%= vars.ops_manager %> log no longer lists the deployment as <code>failing</code>,
  <a href="#upgrade-all">re-run the errand</a> to upgrade the rest of the instances.
</p>
