To validate connectivity, do the following:

1. To SSH into <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> broker, run the following command:

	```
	bosh -d service-instance_GUID ssh
	```

1. If no BOSH `task-id` appears in the error message, look in the broker log using
the `broker-request-id` from the task.
