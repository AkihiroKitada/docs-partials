When you deploy <%= vars.product_name %>, you must create a statically defined network to host the component virtual
machines that constitute the <%= vars.product_name %> infrastructure.

<%= vars.product_name %> components, like the Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.
On-demand <%= vars.product_name %> services may require that you host them on a network that runs separately
from the <%= vars.product_name %> default network. You can also deploy tiles on separate service networks to
meet your own security requirement.

<%= vars.product_name %> v2.1 and later include dynamic networking. Operators can use this dynamic networking with
asynchronous service provisioning to define dynamically-provisioned service networks. For more
information, see [Default Network and Service Network](#on-demand).

In <%= vars.product_name %> v2.1 and later, on-demand services are enabled by default on all networks. Operators can
create separate networks to host services in BOSH Director, but doing so is optional.
Operators select which network hosts on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for
that service.
