If you encounter

<pre class="terminal">
error: failed to set credentials in credential store:
The request includes an unrecognized parameter 'mode'.
Please update or remove this parameter and retry your request.

after upgrading from PCF 2.3 to 2.4, it is likely because one or more on-demand brokers
you have installed were not restarted during the upgrade. To clear the cached server verison and enable
your on-demand brokers to communicate with CredHub v2, do the procedure in
[Run BOSH Restart on Your On-Demand Service Brokers]
(http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#bosh-restart).
