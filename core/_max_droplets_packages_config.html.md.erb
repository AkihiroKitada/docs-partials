In the **File Storage** pane, you determine where you would like to place your Cloud Controller's file storage.

1. Select **File Storage**.

1. To set the maximum number of recent, valid packages your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum valid packages per app** field. Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. However, you may want to lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. To set the maximum number of recent, valid droplets your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum staged droplets per app** field. Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. However, you may want to lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. Under **Configure file storage backup level**, select what to backup from your blobstores:
	* **Complete file storage backup** will include the entire blobstore (droplets, package and buildpacks).
	* **Exclude droplets from file storage backup** excludes droplets from your backup.
	* **Exclude droplets and packages from file storage backup** excludes droplets and packages from your backup.

	To understand the risks and trade offs of excluding droplets and packages, see [File Storage Backup Level](./backup-restore/file-storage-backup-level.html).

1. For **Configure your Cloud Controller's filesystem**, see [Configuring File Storage for PAS](./pas-file-storage.html).
