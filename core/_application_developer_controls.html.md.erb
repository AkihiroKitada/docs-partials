In the App Developer Controls pane, you configure restrictions and default settings for your apps.

1. Select **App Developer Controls**. The following image shows the **App Developer Controls** pane.

    ![There is a heading at the top of the Application Developer Controls page that begins with the text, Configure restrictions and default settings. There are several fields on the Application Developer Controls page. The first three fields are Maximum File Upload Size, Default App Memory, and Default App Memory. There is a Save button at the bottom of the page.](images/app-dev-controls.png)

1. Enter the **Maximum file upload size** in MB. This is the maximum size of an app upload.

1. Enter the **Maximum package size** in MB. This is the maximum total size of an app's files.

1. Enter the **Default app memory** in MB. This is the default amount of memory allocated to a newly-pushed app if no value is specified with `cf push`.

1. Enter the **Default app memory quota per org** in MB. This is the default memory limit for all apps in an org. The specified limit only applies to the first installation of PAS. After the initial installation, operators can use the cf CLI to change the default value.

1. Enter the **Maximum disk quota per app** in MB. This is the maximum amount of disk allowed per app. 
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you allow developers to push large apps, PAS may have trouble placing them on Cells. Additionally, in the event of a system upgrade or an outage that causes a rolling deploy, larger apps may not successfully re-deploy if there is insufficient disk capacity. Monitor your deployment to ensure your Diego Cells have sufficient disk to run your apps.</p>

1. Enter the **Default disk quota per app** in MB. This is the amount of disk allocated by default to a newly-pushed app if no value is specified with `cf push`. 

1. Enter the **Default service instance quota per org**. The specified limit only applies to the first installation of PAS. After the initial installation, operators can use the cf CLI to change the default value.

1. Enter the **Staging timeout** in seconds. When you stage an app droplet with the Cloud Controller, the server times out after the number of seconds you specify in this field.

1. For **Internal domains**, enter a domain that apps use for internal DNS service discovery. If you specify this domain using `cf push -d`, other PAS apps can reach the pushed app at `APP-NAME.INTERNAL-DOMAIN`. This value defaults to `apps.internal`.

1. Enable the **Allow space developers to manage network policies** checkbox to permit developers to manage their own network policies for their applications. 

1. Click **Save**.
