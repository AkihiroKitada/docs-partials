In the **Authentication and Enterprise SSO** pane, you configure your user store access.

1. Select **Authentication and Enterprise SSO**.

1. To authenticate user sign-ons, your deployment can use one of three types of user database: the UAA server's internal user store, an external SAML identity provider, or an external LDAP server.
    * To use the internal UAA, select the **Internal UAA** option and follow the procedure in [Configuring UAA Password Policy](../opsguide/pw-policy.html) to configure your password policy.
    * To connect to an external identity provider through SAML, select the **SAML identity provider** option and follow the procedure in the [Configuring <%= vars.product_name %> for SAML](../opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-saml) section of the _Configuring Authentication and Enterprise SSO for Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_ topic.
    * To connect to an external LDAP server, select the **LDAP server** option and follow the procedure in the [Configuring LDAP](../opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-ldap) section of the _Configuring Authentication and Enterprise SSO for PAS_ topic.

1. Click **Save**.
