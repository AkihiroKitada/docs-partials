In **File Storage**, determine where you want to place the file storage for 
your Cloud Controller.

1. Select **File Storage**.

1. To set the maximum number of recent valid packages that your app can store, not
including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum valid packages per app** field.
Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. 
However, you can lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. To set the maximum number of recent valid droplets that your app can store, not
including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum staged droplets per app** field. 
Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`.
However, you can lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. Under **Configure file storage backup level**, select what you want to backup from your blobstores:
	* **Complete file storage backup** includes the entire blobstore. 
          This includes droplets, packages, and buildpacks.
	* **Exclude droplets from file storage backup** excludes droplets from your backup. 
          If you choose this option you must restage all apps.
	* **Exclude droplets and packages from file storage backup** excludes droplets and packages from your backup. 
          If you choose this option you must re-push all apps.

	For information about the risks and trade offs of excluding droplets and packages, see
	[File Storage Backup Level](./backup-restore/file-storage-backup-level.html)

1. For **Configure your Cloud Controller's filesystem**, see [Configuring File Storage for PAS](./pas-file-storage.html).
