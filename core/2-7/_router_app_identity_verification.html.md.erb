Choose the method the Gorouter uses to verify app identity under **Router app identity verification**. To enable the Gorouter to verify app identity using TLS, select **Router uses TLS to verify app identity**. To enable the Gorouter and your apps to verify each other's identity using TLS, select **Router and apps use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**.
  	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Mutual TLS (mTLS) app identity verification does not work for Windows containers.</p>
  	Verifying app identity using TLS or mutual TLS enables encryption between router and app containers and guards against misrouting during control plane failures. For more information about Gorouter route consistency modes, see [Preventing Misrouting](../concepts/http-routing.html#consistency) section in the _HTTP Routing_.
  	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To support mutual TLS app identity verification, you need v2.3 or later of both PAS and <%= vars.product_full %> Isolation Segment (IST). The Gorouter and Diego Cell components in <%= vars.product_short %> v2.2 and earlier do not support mTLS handshakes.</p>
  	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This feature does not work if the <strong>Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment</strong> checkbox is enabled in the <strong>Networking</strong> pane.</p>
