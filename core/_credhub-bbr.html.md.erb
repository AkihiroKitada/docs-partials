In <%= vars.first_product_name  %>, you can back up CredHub and its data with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.product_name_full %>](../customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

Ensure you also back up your encryption key. If you do not back up your encryption key, you cannot restore your BBR backups. See [Backing Up the Encryption Keys](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/credhub/backup-restore.html#encryption-keys).
