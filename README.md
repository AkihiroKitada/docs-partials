# PCF Docs Partials Repo

This project contains cross product partials for the [RabbitMQ for Pivotal Platform](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-rabbitmq-pcf), [MySQL for Pivotal Platform](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-mysql), [Internal MySQL for PAS](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-mysql-pas), [Redis for Pivotal Platform](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-redis), and [Pivotal Cloud Cache](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-cloud-cache) and other PCF content repos.

This repo allows products with cross-product partials to pull from one versioned source.
Previously, these partials were sourced from the v018.x branch of the
[On Demand Service Broker SDK](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-on-demand-service-broker) content repo and
did not support versions.
