# Services Partials Repo

This project contains cross-product partials for the [RabbitMQ for PCF](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-rabbitmq-pcf), [MySQL for PCF](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-mysql), [Redis for PCF](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-redis), and [Pivotal Cloud Cache](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-cloud-cache) content repos.

This repo allows products with cross-product partials to pull from one versioned source.
Previously, these partials were all counterintuitively sourced from the v018.x branch of the 
[On Demand Service Broker SDK](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-on-demand-service-broker) and 
did not support versions.
