When you deploy <%= vars.product_name  %>, you must create a statically defined network to host the component virtual
machines that constitute the <%= vars.product_name  %> infrastructure.

<%= vars.product_name  %> components, like the Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.
In <%= vars.product_name  %> v2.0 and earlier, on-demand <%= vars.product_name  %> services require that you host them on a network that runs
separately from this network.

Cloud operators pre-provision service instances from Ops Manager. Then, for each service, Ops
Manager allocates and recovers static IP addresses from a pre-defined block of addresses.

To enable on-demand services in <%= vars.product_name  %> v2.0 and earlier, operators must create a service networks in
BOSH Director and select the **Service Network** checkbox. Operators then can select the
service network to host on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for that service.
